## Purpose
The puprose of this exercise is to utilize Tableau to visulize data from the New York Citi Bike program to present to potential investors for a possible expansion in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
After using Tableau to collect and anyalze our data, we were able to create the following visualizations:

### Fig 1. Citi Bike Customers
![customers](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/customers.PNG)
As we can see from our analysis, the Citi Bike program currently has 2,344,224 customers.  1,900,359 of them are subscribers. A little over 81% of our customers are subscribers.


### Fig 2. Citi Bike Starting Locations
![starting_points](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/starting_locations.PNG)
The Citi Bike program offers numerous starting locations through out the city for people to enjoy the service.


### Fig 3. Citi Bike Customer Demographic
![gender_checkout](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/checkout_by_gender.PNG)
Here we can see that we have a heavy male customer demographic. 


### Fig 4. Citi Bike Check Out Times
![checkout_times](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/checkout_times.PNG)
From this analysis of the data we notice that we have over 140 thousand users who use the service for short rides. About 5 minutes each.


### Fig 5. Citi Bike Trips by Gender
![trips_by_gender](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_by_gender.PNG)
Here we deatil the amount of use broke down by the hour by our customers.  This is then sorted by gender to get an idea of when the bikes are being used and by who.  A useful analysis to help determine downtime, maintainence of the bikes and peak usage hours.


### Fig 6. Citi Bike Trips by Users
![user_trips](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/user_trips_gender.PNG)
We can again take this data and see which days are favored by our customers.


### Fig 7. Citi Bike Trips by Weekday
![trips_weekday](https://github.com/Jbailey8316/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_weekday.PNG)
Finally we can have an over all look at the hour by hour use per day across all our customers.


## Summary
In summary, the Citi Bike program seems to be very popular.  A high number of the overall customers are subscribers.  This could indicate that most users prefer to frequent the service enough to pay for a subscription.  Given the high number of starting locations, the service could be viewed as being very accessible to our potential customers and current subscribers.  Our customer base has a high use among males.  This could be an oppurtinuty to increase our service by changing some advertisments or offering incentives to attract new customers and subscribers.  We can also offer incentives to raise use on non-peak hours.  However, the Citi Bike program gets used around the clock indicating its popularity in the area.  An expansion of this service into other cities would likely seem to be profitable.  

A few other analysis I would perform on this data set would to be see what the average age of our customers are.  This could potentially lead to an oppurtunity to offer more accessible bikes to younger or older users.  I would also analyze the start and stop locations with usage time frames to see what the peak usage areas and times are to allow more bikes to be offered and to assist with maintainence planning.  In short this program is successful and has the potentail to be expanded to make it even more accessible than it currently is.  Whether that expansion is done locally in New York or in another location like Des Moines, Iowa.
